# Proposal

- Store roleplay categories in DB then do a client side fetch on characters under that category since data can be mutated (selecting category updates the character data)
- Integrate [cva.style](https://cva.style/) for better management of tailwind classes / styling UI components
- Improve fetch logic / create useFetch hook to improve error handling
- Apply the image placehold blur to images in AI Voice & Generate AI section
- Improve loading logic and animation (Lazy loading, Suspense, etc)
- Configure prettier / eslint for clean and consistent codebase
